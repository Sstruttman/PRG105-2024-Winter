# This code could be used to calculate miles per gallon on any car

# First acquire variables tank size and distance driven
tank_size = 15
distance = 600
# Calculate miles per gallon with simple equation
mpg = distance / tank_size
# Print miles per gallon calculated previously
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg)
